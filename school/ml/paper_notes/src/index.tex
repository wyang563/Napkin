\section{Multimodal Automated Interpretability}
\subsection{Intro}
MAIA is an interpretability agent that can predict and explain the behavior of neural networks in computer vision models. 
Specifically, it does better in reducing sensitivity to spurious features and identify inputs that are misclassified.\\
